# Exploratory Data Analysis of Red Wine Dataset

As part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program, this project aims to identify which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines.

The codes are written in R and can be found in `red_wine.rmd`. The results of
the analysis can be reviewed in `red_wine.html`. `rwineQualityReds.csv` is the
raw data used in the analysis.
